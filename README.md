# Costa Rica Household Poverty Prediction
## Overview
The objective of this project is to predict household poverty levels in Costa Rica. The dataset includes a variety of household characteristics that can be used to predict the level of poverty in each household. Our approach involves thorough data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and testing various machine learning models.
 

## Dataset
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/overview

## Project Highlights
- Standardized features and addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  Created new composite features to enhance model performance (e.g., Living Conditions Index).
- Focused on **recall**, especially for higher poverty levels (to minimize false negatives).
- **Logistic Regression** performed best in terms of recall for the most vulnerable households.
- XGBoost and Random Forest had higher overall accuracy but lower recall.
